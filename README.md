# Mathematische Grundlagen von Computergrafik und Gestaltung
This repository contains supporting code for the lecture MaGrCGGe (MKB2) in the winter term 2023/24

## Usage
The code has been developed and demonstrated using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Settings and extension recommendations are committed.

## Vector and matrix calculus in 2D
Open [index.html](./index.html) using the live server extension. Change the ```drawStuff()``` method in [main.js](./main.js) in order to experiment with vectors and matrices in 2D. The implementation of the mathematical functions (add, scale, ...) is done in [math.js](./math.js).

## Rotation of images
Open [rotation.html](./rotation.html) using the live server extension. Move the slider to rotate the image. Below the image, the rotation matrix is shown, once with numbers and once with sine and cosine of the rotation angle.

## 3D cameras in WebGL with Three.JS
tbd.
